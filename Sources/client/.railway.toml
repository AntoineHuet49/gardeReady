# Railway project configuration for Client
# This file helps Railway CLI identify which service to deploy

# You'll need to update these values with your actual Railway project and service IDs
# Get them from: railway project --json and railway service --json

# Example format:
# projectId = "your-project-id"
# serviceId = "your-client-service-id"
